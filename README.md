# eMoflon::IBeX

eMoflon::IBeX is an Eclipse-based incremental interpreter for
	bidirectional graph transformations based on Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs)
	and unidirectional graph transformations.
It uses [eMoflon::IBeX UI](https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-ibex-ui)
	for the textual rule specification.

This repository contains only the part which is independent from a concrete pattern matcher.
[eMoflon::IBeX Democles](https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-ibex-democles)
	uses eMoflon::IBeX with the Democles pattern matching engine.
