/**
 * All suffixes used to distinguish the different patterns based on their names.
 * 
 * The context of a pattern is is the part of the pattern that consists of the
 * context elements of the original TGG rule.
 * 
 * The source/target/corr components of a pattern are the parts of the pattern
 * that consist of source/target/corr elements of the original TGG rule.
 * 
 * DEC refers to the "Dangling Edge Condition", i.e., the presence of edges that
 * can never be translated caused by applying a certain rule (thus violating
 * DEC).
 * 
 * Our synchronisation "protocol" is an extra model that provides markers for a
 * model triple. If all elements are marked (connected to protocol nodes) in
 * this manner then it is consistent.
